**How it works**:
- The team coordinator analyzes your query.
- Tasks are delegated to specialists (Searcher, YahooFinance, General).
- Responses are synthesized into a final answer.
- Team memory retains context within this session.

**Example queries**:
- "What are the latest AI breakthroughs?"
- "Crawl agno.com and summarize the homepage."
- "Summarize the YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
- "What was the first question I asked you?" (tests memory)
